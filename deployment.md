# SUTD QBot Deployment
Original guide could be found in the [UNSW QBot Repository](https://github.com/unsw-edu-au/QBot).

Here, we will detail the step-by-step process of deploying the application including setting up the Azure resources in case user is unfamiliar with the Azure ecosystem.

## 1. Setting Up Azure Subscription
First, in order to deploy any resources on Azure, we need a subscription set up. 
In portal.azure.com, go to the Subscriptions page and click on the "Add" button.

For this deployment, leave all the details to default and click on the "Create" button.

**Sanity check**: The subscription plan takes about 10 minutes to create. Afterwards, if you go to Home > Subscriptions, you should be able to see the new subscription plan.

Next, if you are not the billing administrator of this project, you could modify the billing details of this project to another account.

First, navigate to `Cost Management + Billing` and click the triple dot on the relevant subscription, followed with `Transfer billing ownership`.
